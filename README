A script to help downloading the Android sources and copy them to your sdk 
directory, so you can see them in Eclipse.
This script uses the excellent project 'browse-androidsdk-sources-in-eclipse'
at http://code.google.com/p/browse-androidsdk-sources-in-eclipse/.
Please see the issue http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=979
for an explanation of why all this is needed.
